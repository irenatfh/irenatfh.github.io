Hey there, I'm Irena! Currently, I'm a data reporter at [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/people/irena-hwang) where I'm usually coding up [data analysis pipelines](https://www.propublica.org/article/pandemic-outbreak-guinea-forest-propublica-analysis), writing methodology columns [[1](https://www.propublica.org/article/salmon-hatcheries-pnw-fish-data), [2](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-propublica-used-genomic-sequencing-data-to-track-an-ongoing-salmonella-outbreak)], and creating graphics [[3](https://www.propublica.org/article/ebola-spillover-machine-learning-methodology-nigeria), [4](https://www.propublica.org/article/salmon-hatcheries-government-climate-change)] for accountability reporting.

In the past, I've worked with some really great teams, including the folks at [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/) [[5](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/09/922424987/political-ad-nausea), [6](https://www.tiktok.com/@planetmoney/video/6917675625725644038), [7](https://twitter.com/planetmoney/status/1337423710592978944?s=20)], [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com) [[8](https://apnews.com/b62eacec9bd3fff89eeab1a8de72f819), [9](https://apnews.com/02a0542e8a05176bd5d79757134bc277), [10](https://apnews.com/1583bc741a22867b85807cc8f18552e9)], [Big Local News](https://biglocalnews.org/#/about) [[11](https://source.opennews.org/articles/comparison-four-major-covid-19-data-sources/), [12](https://www.kqed.org/news/11713393/wildland-development-escalates-california-fire-costs)], and [The Dallas Morning News](https://www.dallasnews.com/author/irena-fischer-hwang/).

I also love working with aspiring journalists through student training programs. I've worked with the [AAJA Voices](https://voices.aaja.org/) ([13](https://aajavoices.org/losangeles2022/voices-investigation-journalisms-top-awards-lack-diverse-judges/), [14](https://voices.aaja.org/index/2021/8/26/few-black-and-hispanic-students-are-editors-of-top-college-newspapers-survey-finds)) program and the [Chips Quinn Scholars Program for Diversity in Journalism](https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/initiatives/chips-quinn-scholars-program-for-diversity-in-journalism/). My path to data journalism was very nonlinear (I stumbled into it while completing a PhD in [electrical engineering](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FXiSi-4AAAAJ&hl=en)), so I'm happy to do informational chats with students â€” particularly doctoral candidates in STEM fields. Just send me an email to find a time to talk!
