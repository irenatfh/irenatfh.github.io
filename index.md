Hey there, I'm Irena. I used to be an [electrical engineer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FXiSi-4AAAAJ&hl=en) :electric_plug:, and now I'm a data reporter at [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/). In the course of my professional wanderings, I've had the privilege of working with some really great teams. Here are some highlights:

### Planet Money
Podcasts are what lured me into journalism in the first place, so getting to work with the [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/) team was a dream come true. There, I learned a ton about audio storytelling, economics and creating that distinctive NPR-quality sound in ProTools. I also produced [graphics](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/10/27/927842540/the-dark-side-of-the-recovery-revealed-in-big-data) for the newsletter, crunched numbers for some [episodes](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/09/922424987/political-ad-nauseam), wrote some pret-ty quality [social](https://twitter.com/planetmoney/status/1337423710592978944?s=20) [media](https://twitter.com/planetmoney/status/1339611427003363329?s=20) [posts](https://twitter.com/planetmoney/status/1342460338726445056?s=20) and tried my hand at explaining economics via TikTok [videos](https://www.tiktok.com/@planetmoney/video/6904685462078770438) ([twice](https://www.tiktok.com/@planetmoney/video/6917675625725644038)).

### The Associated Press
My data journalism work at the AP centered on analysis and data visualization, and included a bit of science communication. I learned a ton about data reporting for a news wire, and the importance of listening to good :musical_note::notes: while coding.

### Big Local News
I cut my data journalism teeth with [BLN](https://biglocalnews.org/#/about). I didn't expect to report explicitly on disasters, but sometimes that's just how the :cookie: crumbles.

* [Wildland development escalates California fire costs](https://www.kqed.org/news/11713393/wildland-development-escalates-california-fire-costs)

### The Dallas Morning News
My first newsroom experience was [writing features](https://www.dallasnews.com/author/JMUM6E4O4KTZ3FCQLEGK5XLHXU/) for the Arts and Entertainment desk at the Morning News. Outside the newsroom, I developed a taste for Tex-Mex and :taco:, and got used to things like armadillo roadkill and Topo Chico everywhere.

I also occasionally do freelance work:
