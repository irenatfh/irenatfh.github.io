Hey there, I'm Irena! I'm a data reporter at [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/people/irena-hwang), and I used to do research in [electrical engineering](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FXiSi-4AAAAJ&hl=en) _(which is why I sometimes cry from nostalgia in MRI machines and have vivid dreams about teaching the complex conjugate root theorem)_. These days, I code up [data analysis pipelines](https://www.propublica.org/article/pandemic-outbreak-guinea-forest-propublica-analysis), write explanatory methodology columns ([1](https://www.propublica.org/article/salmon-hatcheries-pnw-fish-data), [2](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-propublica-used-genomic-sequencing-data-to-track-an-ongoing-salmonella-outbreak)), and design informational graphics ([3](https://www.propublica.org/article/ebola-spillover-machine-learning-methodology-nigeria), [4](https://www.propublica.org/article/salmon-hatcheries-government-climate-change)) for accountability reporting.

I've had the privilege of working with really great teams along the way, including the folks at [Planet Money](https://www.tiktok.com/@planetmoney/video/6917675625725644038), [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/b62eacec9bd3fff89eeab1a8de72f819), [Big Local News](https://www.kqed.org/news/11713393/wildland-development-escalates-california-fire-costs), and [The Dallas Morning News](https://www.dallasnews.com/author/irena-fischer-hwang/).

I also love working with aspiring journalists through student training programs. I've worked with the [AAJA Voices](https://voices.aaja.org/) ([5](https://aajavoices.org/losangeles2022/voices-investigation-journalisms-top-awards-lack-diverse-judges/), [6](https://voices.aaja.org/index/2021/8/26/few-black-and-hispanic-students-are-editors-of-top-college-newspapers-survey-finds)) program and the [Chips Quinn Scholars Program for Diversity in Journalism](https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/initiatives/chips-quinn-scholars-program-for-diversity-in-journalism/). My path to journalism was very nonlinear, so I'm happy to do informational chats with students â€” particularly doctoral candidates in STEM fields. Just send me an email to find a time to talk!
