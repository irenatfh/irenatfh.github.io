Hey there, I'm Irena. I'm a mix of data journalist, narrative storyteller and science communicator (or total geek, because I used to be an [electrical engineer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FXiSi-4AAAAJ&hl=en) :electric_plug:). Currently, I crunch numbers, help produce episodes and write what I believe are pret-ty fun tweets for [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/). I've had the privilege of working with some really great teams — here are some highlights:

### The Associated Press
My data journalism work at the AP centered on analysis and data visualization, and included a bit of science communication. I learned a ton about data reporting for a news wire, and the importance of listening to good :musical_note::notes: while coding.

* [America’s Medical Supply Crisis](https://globalreportingcentre.org/medical-supply-crisis/)
* [Scarcity of key material squeezes medical mask manufacturing](https://apnews.com/02a0542e8a05176bd5d79757134bc277)
* [Small businesses in college towns struggle without students](https://apnews.com/1583bc741a22867b85807cc8f18552e9)

### Big Local News
I cut my data journalism teeth with [BLN](https://biglocalnews.org/#/about). I didn't expect to report explicitly on disasters, but sometimes that's just how the :cookie: crumbles.
* [A comparison of four major COVID-19 data sources](https://source.opennews.org/articles/comparison-four-major-covid-19-data-sources/)
* [Wildland development escalates California fire costs](https://www.kqed.org/news/11713393/wildland-development-escalates-california-fire-costs)

### The Dallas Morning News
My first newsroom experience was [writing features](https://www.dallasnews.com/author/JMUM6E4O4KTZ3FCQLEGK5XLHXU/) for the Arts and Entertainment desk at the Morning News. Outside the newsroom, I developed a taste for Tex-Mex and :taco:, and got used to things like armadillo roadkill and Topo Chico everywhere.
